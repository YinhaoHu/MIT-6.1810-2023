Q1: Which other xv6 system call(s) could be made faster using this shared page? Explain how.

A: SYS_uptime. Add a field in the USYSCALL page, and maps the address of that to the physical address of `ticks` 
in the kernel trap.c.

Q2: For every leaf page in the vmprint output, explain what it logically contains and what its permission bits are. 
Figure 3.4 in the xv6 book might be helpful, although note that the figure might have a slightly different set of 
pages than the init process that's being inspected here.

A: 255-511-(509,510,511) -> USYSCALL page, trapframe page, trampoline page.
0-0-(0,1,2,3) -> Text page, data page, guard page,stack page.
