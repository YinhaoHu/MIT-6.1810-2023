Consider in a moment just after the program started two threads begin to put
two keys which are in the same bucket which is empty now. In the sequence below:

time:

T1  : Begin to insert bucket 0 -> update the bucket head

T2  : Begin to insert bucket 0 -> update the bucket head


now, the bucket head is one of the key but missing one.
